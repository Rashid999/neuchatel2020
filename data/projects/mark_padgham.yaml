description: "rOpenSci is an organisation dedicated to _Transforming science through open data and software,_ primarily via our own system for peer-reviewing and curating R packages. Our peer review system accepts packages from a variety of categories mainly focussed on data workflows, and we have recently embarked upon a project to expand the scope of peer review to include statistical software--arguably the _true_ core business of the R language. This project provides an opportunity to reconstruct and reconfigure how peer review of software might function. In this talk, I will briefly outline the future vision of this project, and then focus in particular on visions for how testing might be reconceptualised to play a more central role in the development and assessment of R packages."
