description: "Shiny applications tend to lack user feedback, upon clicking on a button or selecting an item from a dropdown the user is left wondering whether their action actually registered. The waiter package (https://waiter.john-coene.com/) remedies to this by providing a way for the developer to programmatically show and hide loading screens with spinners or loading bars either on the entire app or on parts of the app. It's extremely easy to use and allows making apps feel slicker."
