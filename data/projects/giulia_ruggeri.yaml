description: "Over the past years, R has become a comprehensive toolbox for visualizing geospatial data and perform geostatistical analysis. In particular, the {sf} and {raster} packages include all the necessary functions to visualize and manipulate vector and raster data. The visualization possibilities have although increased with packages such as {rayshader}, {leaflet} and {mapview}. In this talk we will see how to create maps in R, using different packages, going from static representation to interactive ones."
