description: "Machine learning permeates our lives, with prospects to drive our cars and decide on our medical treatments. These ambitions will not materialize if the learning models remain unable to explain their behaviour when performing under diverse situations. Hence, any domain of science and application benefits from causal inference methods. While the golden standard for causal discovery is randomized control trials, experiments or interventions in a system are often prohibitively expensive, unethical, or, in many cases, impossible. In this context, an alternative is to use observational data to infer causal relationships. The objective of this talk is to tackle this challenge, by presenting three algorithms to distinguish causes from effects based on the independence of cause and mechanism postulate [1]). We will present  the common intuition shared by three different approaches, their mathematical formulation and the corresponding R implementations and evaluation.
