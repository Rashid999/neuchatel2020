description: "The output of PartnerRe's data science team is often deployed to production. Examples include automated reports used by decision makers, tools for reinsurance pricing (e.g. simulation engines) and trained machine learning models that support work flows in our company. In our context, production' means that something is used by non-technical users in a business critical context. Consequently, production content needs to be highly available and users expect complete reproducibility of all results. To make R fit for this purpose, we have developed a set of best practices around how we structure and version control our code and the environments our code runs in. In this talk, we focus on the open source infrastructure supporting this process: version control, continuous integration, containerization and container deployment and orchestration. We conclude this presentation by illustrating this framework through some applications."
